## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm learning programming on my own after taking a couple C++ classes several lifetimes ago and then moving out of computer work. Currently working as a solo handyman/contractor, but hoping to move to a less (physically) painful field soon, so if you have any tips on getting hired feel free to pass them along!
